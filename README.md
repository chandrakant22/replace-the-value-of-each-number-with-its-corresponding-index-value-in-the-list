# replace-the-value-of-each-number-with-its-corresponding-index-value-in-the-list
<H2>Company : LTI </H2><br/>You are given a list of N unique positive numbers ranging from 0 to (N -1).  
<br/><h2>Write an algorithm to replace the value of each number with its corresponding index value in the list.  </H2>
<br/><b>Input</b> <br/>
The first line of the input consists of an integer size,  representing the size of the list (N).
<br/> The next line consists of N space. separated integers, arr[0], arr[1]...arr[N-1]  representing the given list ofnumbers.  

<br/><b>Output</b> <br/>
Print N space-separated integers representing the list Obtained by replacing the values of the numbers with their corresponding index values in the list  Constraints 0 &lt; size ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ i &lt; size  
<br/><b>Note</b> <br/>
All the numbers in the list are unique<br/> 

<b>Example</b> <br/>
Input. 4 3 2 0 1  <br/>
Output: 2 3 1 0  <br/>

<b>Explanation:</b>  <br/>
Before the change, the elements of the list are: arr[0]=3, arr[1] =2, arr[2]=0 and arr[3]=1 <br/>
After the change, the elements of the list are arr[0]=2, arr[1]=3, arr[2]=1 and arr[3]=0
