# replace-the-value-of-each-number-with-its-corresponding-index-value-in-the-list
Company : LTI You are given a list of N unique positive numbers ranging from 0 to (N -1).  Write an algorithm to replace the value of each number with its corresponding index value in the list.  Input The first line of the input consists of an integer size,  representing the size of the list (N). The next line consists of N space. separated integers, arr[0], arr[1]...arr[N-1]  representing the given list ofnumbers.  Output Print N space-separated integers representing the list Obtained by replacing the values of the numbers with their corresponding index values in the list  Constraints 0 &lt; size ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5 0 ≤ i &lt; size  Note All the numbers in the list are unique  Example Input. 4 3 2 0 1  Output: 2 3 1 0  Explanation:  Before the change, the elements of the list are: arr[0]=3, arr[1] =2, arr[2]=0 and arr[3]=1 After the change, the elements of the list are arr[0]=2, arr[1]=3, arr[2]=1 and arr[3]=0
